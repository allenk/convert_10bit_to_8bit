## Convert_10bit_to_8bit (via ffmpeg & nvenc_h264)

A small Windows batch file to convert 10bit video files to 8bit using ffmpeg and nvenc_h264. Requires Windows and a NVIDIA graphics card.


## Motivation

My Raspberry PI can't run hi10 videos - yeah, anime :( So I created a quick script to convert 10bit videos to 8bit. 

## Installation

- Copy all the files in a directory
- Set the "eight_bit_path" parameter in "convert_10bit_to_8bit.bat" batch file.
- Drag and drop the video file you would like to convert on to the batch file.
