## Convert_10bit_to_8bit (via ffmpeg & nvenc_h264)

A small Windows batch file to convert 10bit video files  to 8bit using ffmpeg and nvenc_h264. Requires Windows and a NVIDIA graphics card.


## Motivation

My raspberry PI can't run hi10 videos :( So I created a quick script to convert hi10 anime videos to 8bit. 

## Installation

- Copy all the files in a directory
- Set the "eight_bit_path" parameter in batch file
- Drag and drop the video file you would like to convert on to the "convert_10bit_to_8bit.bat" 

## License

Free to use, fork it if you like!
